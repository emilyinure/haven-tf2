- Main focus for the project was projectile prediction/aimbot
- Still has redundant and messy code, will be refactoring when I have time aside from my other projects
- Using a outdated version of a friends framework as a base. Not much is left the same but still a necessary credit!

### How to use
- Inject using Process Hacker or any other injector
- To open and close the menu, press insert
- When using keybinds, right click to change the activation mode, by default keybinds are always active, regardless of the key state
